Open and save 3D image stacks as animated gifs

You find the menus for opening and saving animated gifs in the `Tools > File Import/Export` menu:

Furthermore, if in 3D view, you can save the current view with a little tilt animation as animated gif.
Under the hood this uses the [microfilm](https://github.com/guiwitz/microfilm) library.

If in 2D view, you can also make an animation by going throught the 2D slices of the currently visible dimension/axis. This is implemented in a similar way to the 3D view animations using [microfilm](https://github.com/guiwitz/microfilm), but due to some conflicts with converting 2D slices to microfilm's colorspace it has also been implemented using [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/). It is recommended to select the "use Pillow to generate gif" option to avoid color issues in your animation.

The mouse scan used is from [Rosenhain, S., Magnuska, Z., Yamoah, G. et al. A preclinical micro-computed tomography database including 3D whole body organ segmentations.](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.294) and labels are predicted using an nnUNet architecture trained on data from the same study.
